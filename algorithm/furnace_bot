This is from think like a coder ep4 from youtube.

take a furnace bot
check it's furnace number
compare it's furnace number with shell of all other bots
if the bot's shell number matches 
	this is not the parent bot
else this is the parent bot
	upload control program

do this until bot is found
take the funace number of this bot
comapre this bot's furnace nuumber with shall of all other bots
if the bot's shell number matches 
	this is not the parent bot
else this is the parent bot
	upload control program
end of loop
