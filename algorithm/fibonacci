SETP2

add x and y
write down the result z

add y and z
write down the result a

add z and a
write down the result b

SETP3
start loop 
ask "how many numbers of Fibonacci should be printed?"
save the value in l
if l > 0 exit the loop
say "please enter a valid number"
loop ends

start with x = 0 and y = 1

loop start from 1 to l
	add x and y
	write down the result
	save it in z
	put value of y inside x
	put value of z inside y
